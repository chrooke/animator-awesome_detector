# Bouncing Off The Walls

This is one of the animations used in the Awesome Detector and Animator.

This moves a pixel in a random direction on the LED matrix, traveling in a straight line until it reaches the "wall", i.e. the edge of the matrix. When it hits the wall it picks a new random direction that keeps it in the matrix, then heads that way until it hits the wall again.

# Animator

This is a light and (optional) sound display used for decoration. Every thirty seconds (configurable by changing TIME_PER_STATE) it plays a random transition and then random animation, possibly with several parameters also randomized.

You can compile without sound by commenting out the definition of AUDIO.

# Awesome Detector

This program "detects" awesome people and things with an ultrasonic range finder. It's meant to be worn as a button on your shirt. As you talk to someone, it starts to pick up the awesome and change the animation, until finally the person sets off the awesome alarm.

It could also go off if you stand in front of something and gaze at it long enough. 

You can compile without sound by commenting out the definition of AUDIO.

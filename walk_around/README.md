# Walk Around

This is one of the animations used in the Awesome Detector and Animator.

This moves a pixel in a random direction on the LED matrix. Every time it moves, it picks a new random direction for its next move.  If it reaches the "wall", i.e. the edge of the matrix it picks a new random direction that keeps it in the matrix, then heads that way until it hits the wall again.
